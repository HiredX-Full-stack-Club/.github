# Contributing to HiredX Full-stack Club

Welcome to the HiredX Full-stack Club! We're excited to have you contribute to our community and projects. Your contributions, no matter how small, are invaluable.

By participating in this organization, you agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/HiredX-Fullstack-Club/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## How to Contribute

This document outlines general guidelines for contributing across our various repositories. Specific repositories may have additional contribution instructions in their own `CONTRIBUTING.md` files.

### 1. Find a Place to Contribute

* **Explore our Repositories:**
    * **`community-hub`**: For general club information, vision, and how to get involved.
    * **`roadmap`**: To contribute to our learning path, suggest new topics, or improve existing ones.
    * **`events`**: To propose new event ideas, or help document past events.
    * **`projects`**: To get involved in collaborative coding projects.
* **Look for Issues:** Many repositories will use GitHub Issues to track tasks, bugs, and feature requests. Look for issues labeled "good first issue" or "help wanted" if you're new to contributing.

### 2. Proposing Changes (Pull Requests)

For code, documentation, or content changes:

1.  **Fork** the repository you want to contribute to.
2.  **Clone** your forked repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git)
    cd repository-name
    ```
3.  **Create a new branch** for your changes.
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
    # or
    git checkout -b bugfix/issue-number
    ```
4.  Make your desired **changes**.
5.  **Commit your changes** with a clear, concise message.
    ```bash
    git commit -m "feat: Add new feature X"
    # or
    git commit -m "docs: Update Y section"
    ```
6.  **Push your branch** to your forked repository.
    ```bash
    git push origin feature/your-feature-name
    ```
7.  **Open a Pull Request (PR)** from your forked repository's branch to the `main` branch of the original repository.
    * Provide a clear title and description for your PR.
    * Reference any related issues (e.g., "Closes #123").

### 3. Reporting Bugs / Suggesting Features (Issues)

If you find a bug, have a feature idea, or want to suggest a change:

1.  Go to the **`Issues` tab** of the relevant repository (e.g., `roadmap/issues` for roadmap ideas).
2.  Click "New Issue".
3.  Choose the appropriate issue template (if available) and fill out the details as thoroughly as possible.

### 4. Communication

* **GitHub Issues/PRs:** Preferred for discussions directly related to code, features, or specific content changes.
* **WhatsApp Group:** For general chat, quick questions, or broader community discussions.
* **Club Meetings/Events:** For live discussions, workshops, and deeper dives.
